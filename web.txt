How does the internet work?

    The internet is a network compiled of smaller networks. These networks can communicate with each other by requesting and sending data. One computer can send a request to another because each computer has a unique ip address. We receive data when we send a request to a server that then sends a response back. Servers have domain names that are assigned to their ip address so it can be easier for users to request data by using urls. 

What happens when you click on a link?

    When you clink on a link, you are essentially sending a request to a server. Your request is sent to a server using an http or https protocol. The hostname of the link you clicked is turned into an ip address that is accessed by the DNS. If the link has a resource then the server knows to only send the resource you requested.
